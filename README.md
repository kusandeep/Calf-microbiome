# CalfSMART-microbiome
This repository presents the files and methods used for statistical analyses of the faecal bacterial community profiles and SCFA data generated from calves raised on three different allowances of milk replacer: 10% of initial bodyweight (LA), 20% of initial bodyweight (HA), and ad libitum (ADLIB). Faecal samples were collected at pre-weaning.
